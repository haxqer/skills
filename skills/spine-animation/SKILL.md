# Spine Animation

Turn existing 2D character art into a rigged, animated, previewable Spine skeleton.
The bundled `scripts/` do the heavy numerical work (part positioning, JSON
assembly, atlas packing, preview rendering); your job is to drive them, judge the
visual result, and correct it.

This skill produces **Spine-compatible export files** (`.json` + `.atlas` + `.png`)
and an offline HTML preview. It does not require a Spine license to run, but the
output loads in the official Spine editor and runtimes (Unity, Godot, Phaser, web).

## Setup

The scripts are plain Python and run from where they live — no copying to a fixed
path. Set a convenience variable and install dependencies once per session:

```bash
SPINE="$(pwd)/scripts"   # adjust to this skill's scripts/ directory
pip install opencv-python Pillow numpy           # core pipeline
pip install google-genai                         # only for the Gemini split backend
```

`opencv-python`, `Pillow`, and `numpy` cover positioning, atlas packing, and
preview. `google-genai` is only needed if you deconstruct a full image with the
Gemini backend (OpenAI-compatible backends use plain HTTP, no SDK).

## What to get from the user

Confirm two things before starting: **which assets** they have, and **which
animations** they want (idle, walk, run, wave, jump, attack, or something custom).

| Asset set | Path through the pipeline |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| Separated part PNGs **+ assembled reference image** | Best case → auto-position (Step 2) |
| Separated part PNGs only | You place parts from vision/part names; skip auto-position |
| Texture atlas + spritesheet PNG | Parse the `.atlas` for regions/sizes, then rig |
| Single full-character image | Deconstruct into parts first (Step 1), then rig |
| Existing Spine `.json` | Parse it; add/modify animations or correct offsets |

## Pipeline

```
[full image] → split → parts → [+reference] → position → build skeleton → atlas → preview → correct
```

Read a reference doc only when you reach the step that needs it:

- `references/spine-json-format.md` — Spine 4.2 JSON + `.atlas` grammar (read before hand-writing or debugging skeleton JSON)
- `references/rigging-and-coordinates.md` — bone hierarchy, the pixel→Spine coordinate math, and how `position_parts.py` works (read for Steps 2–3)
- `references/animation-presets.md` — what each preset does, the 12 principles, custom-animation and adjustment formats (read for Step 4 and for corrections)

### Step 1 — Deconstruct a full image into parts (only if needed)

If the user has just one assembled image, generate a flat "separated parts" atlas
and segment it into individual transparent PNGs:

```bash
python "$SPINE/split_character.py" character.png --output-dir parts/
# pick a backend/model explicitly when needed:
python "$SPINE/split_character.py" character.png --backend openai --model gpt-image-2 --output-dir parts/
```

It is **provider-agnostic** and shares config conventions with the `game-asset-gen`
skill (`--backend auto|openai|openai-responses|gemini`, `--base-url`, `--model`,
and `OPENAI_API_KEY`/`IMAGE_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY`/`GOOGLE_API_KEY`; a nearby
`.env` is auto-loaded). If the user is already producing art with `game-asset-gen`,
prefer generating clean separated layers there and skip this step.

After segmentation, **rename the generic `part_NN.png` files to meaningful names**
(`head.png`, `torso.png`, `left-upper-arm.png`, …) — the rig and the animation
presets key off these names. Inspect the atlas first; if parts merged or split
badly, regenerate or tune `--min-area` / `--bg-threshold` with `--segment-only`.

### Step 2 — Auto-position parts (when a reference image exists)

```bash
python "$SPINE/position_parts.py" \
  --reference assembled_character.png \
  --parts parts/ \
  --output layout.json \
  --debug debug/
```

This recovers each part's position, scale, rotation, and the draw order via SIFT +
RANSAC with an occlusion-voting z-order pass. **Open `debug/comparison.png` and
verify it visually** — recomposited parts vs. the reference. Without a reference
image, place parts from their names and your reading of the art instead. The
algorithm and correction workflow are detailed in `references/rigging-and-coordinates.md`.

### Step 3 — Build the Spine skeleton JSON

Author a build config describing the skeleton, bones, slots, attachments, and the
requested animations, then generate valid Spine 4.2 JSON:

```bash
python "$SPINE/build_spine_json.py" --config config.json --output skeleton.json
```

Construct `config.json` from the layout: derive bone positions (relative to parent)
and attachment offsets (relative to bone) using the coordinate math in
`references/rigging-and-coordinates.md`. Bones must be listed parent-before-child;
slot order is the draw order. List preset names under `animations`, and put any
bespoke motion under `custom_animations`.

### Step 4 — Author animations

The presets (`idle`, `walk`, `run`, `wave`, `jump`, `attack`) are generated by
naming them in the config — see `references/animation-presets.md` for what each
does and the principles behind them. For anything custom, add a `custom_animations`
block of valid timeline JSON. Looping animations must return to their start values.

### Step 5 — Pack the texture atlas

```bash
python "$SPINE/make_atlas.py" --parts parts/ --output . --name character_name
```

Outputs `character_name.png` (spritesheet) + `character_name.atlas` (metadata).
Region names come from the PNG filenames, so they must match the attachment names
used in the skeleton.

### Step 6 — Generate a preview

A self-contained HTML file (assets embedded as base64) using the official Spine
Web Player — opens in any browser, plays/loops, and lets the user switch animations:

```bash
python "$SPINE/generate_spine_player.py" \
  --skeleton skeleton.json \
  --atlas character_name.atlas \
  --atlas-image character_name.png \
  --output preview.html \
  --animation idle
```

The Spine Web Player loads from a CDN, so the preview needs internet on first open.

### Step 7 — Inspect and correct

Compare the preview against the reference with your own vision. Common fixes:
misplaced attachments (adjust `x`/`y`), wrong layering (reorder slots), or jittery
motion (check that loop endpoints match). Apply corrections to the config or the
skeleton JSON and regenerate — iterating on the preview is the fastest way to
converge. For interactive hand-tuning, an HTML editor that exports an adjustment
file is described in `references/animation-presets.md`.

## Working principles

- **Verify visually at every stage.** The numbers (SIFT matches, occlusion votes)
  are a strong first guess, not ground truth. The `debug/` images and the preview
  are how you actually confirm the rig is right.
- **Names are contracts.** Part filenames → atlas region names → attachment names,
  and bone names → animation presets. Keep them consistent end to end.
- **Regenerate, don't hand-patch.** Prefer editing the config/layout and re-running
  a script over editing generated JSON by hand; it keeps everything in sync.
- **Don't reinvent art generation.** For creating or iterating the source art and
  separated layers, defer to the `game-asset-gen` skill rather than duplicating it.
